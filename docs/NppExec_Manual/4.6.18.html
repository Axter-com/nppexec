<h3>4.6.18. NppExec's Console as a Log Viewer</h3>

<p><em>[the idea was originally proposed by mischlrebl as &quot;show and reload file content periodically&quot; here: https://github.com/d0vgan/nppexec/issues/101]</em></p>

<p>[ mischlrebl: ]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I am wondering if it is possible to watch and track a log file in the Console - like the &quot;Monitoring (tail -f)&quot; function in Notepad++?</p>
  <p>It would be very handy to work with split screen on the files and to see the messages below.</p>

<p>[ DV: ]</p>

  <p>The closest built-in command in NppExec is <i>con_load</i>, though it loads an entire file into the Console window.</p>
  <p>To achieve your goal, you may probably run some external log viewer/watcher implemented as a console application in NppExec's Console.</p>
  <p>This version of <code>tail</code> works good in NppExec's Console: <code>https://github.com/JavaScriptDude/cygtail</code> <br>
  On the cygtail's project page, click the <code>&lt;&gt;Code</code> button and then click <code>Download ZIP</code> there.<br>
  After downloading and extracting the binaries, this command will do the job:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>tail -f log.txt</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p></p>
  <p>BusyBox for Windows also works good in NppExec's Console: <code>https://frippery.org/busybox/</code> <br>
  Once downloaded, this command will do the job:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>busybox tail -f log.txt</pre>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>As I had never thought about NppExec in terms of log viewing, I asked mischlrebl for more details of this use-case.<br>
And here are the resulting images that speak for themselves:</p>

<p>It may also be useful to have one instance of NppExec working as a Log Viewer and another instance of NppExec handling commands and scripts.<br>
Refer to &quot;Using several copies of NppExec&quot; <a href="2.4.html">[2.4]</a> for details.</p>
