NppExec (plugin for Notepad++)

Here is some brief info about NppExec for new users:
* NppExec adds a Console window at the bottom of Notepad++'s window;
This Console window allows to run different console programs directly in it;
Also there is Plugins -> NppExec -> Execute… window that allows to execute NppExec’s scripts (set of commands).
* NppExec’s commands and variables are listed in the “NppExec.txt” file.
* To get more details, type “help” (without the quotes) directly in NppExec’s Console. To get a detailed help about any NppExec’s command, type “help <command>” - e.g. “help npp_open” or “help set”.
And don’t forget about Plugins -> NppExec -> Help/Manual.
